# BibX
XML-based Personal Bibliography Management

BibX is available as a desktop application using Electron and Photon. A Python API (which is no longer supported) is available in the `bibx-python` branch.

## XSLT
A set of XSLT files for transformations to various formats are included in ./app/xml. To date, the following transformations are available:

- Transformation to HTML, sorting by year.
- Transformation to HTML, sorting by publication type.
- Transformation to plain text.
- Transformation to BibTeX.

The citation format roughly follows IEEE style. Support for other formats is forthcoming.
